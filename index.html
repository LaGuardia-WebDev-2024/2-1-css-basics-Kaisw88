    <p>Lynx are awesome because they reside in snowy environments, living solitary, predator lifestyles. Their large furry feet function as their own kind of snow shoe, which allows them to switfly traverse through snowy terrain when hunting prey such as snowshoe hares, rabbits, squirrels, and sometimes deer. <strong></strong>.</p>
